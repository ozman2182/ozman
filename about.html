                    <h1>About Oz</h1>

                    <p>Hi, my name is Oswaldo Mendoza, but everyone calls me Oz. I have been designing and build websites for over 10 years. I enjoy the process of helping my clients create a user-friendly website that will help grow their business. Here’s some more information about me.</p>

                    <h2>My Story</h2>
                    <p>I am a web designer based in Reno, Nevada. I started my career working as an in-house graphic artist for local advertising agencies working on print and collateral material. I learned a lot about creating designs that were print-ready using the latest creative programs and about advertising and marketing. I transitioned into designing for online after getting laid off in 2009. Most of my experience came from freelancing for small businesses and also from working as designer in-house for a digital marketing agency. Currently I work full-time as a senior web designer for the marketing department at the University of Nevada, Reno. This position has allowed me to become more familiar with web accessibility and serve a more diverse audience. I also continue to freelance for marketing agencies in the evenings and on weekends to help them with their projects.</p>

                    <p>When I am not working I enjoy spending time with my wife watching a good Netflix series, hanging out with family and friends, or enjoying being outdoors.</p>
